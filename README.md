    - Download Maven from the [official Maven website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
    - Install JDK and Maven on your computer.
    - Set the paths of JDK and Maven in your environment variables.

3. **Verify the installations:**
    - Open the command line and run `mvn -version`. If the installed Maven version is displayed, the installation was successful.
    - Run `java -version`. If the installed Java version is displayed, the installation was successful.
    - Ensure that Maven is using JDK 1.8.0_202.

4. **Clone the project:**
